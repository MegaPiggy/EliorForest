### New Slimes
So far the slimes that I will be adding are listed here.
Aurora Slime: Cyan/Light-Green colored slime that is found near the Northern Lights. Has a secret style that makes it's color blood red.
Lycan Slime: A wolf that hunts for it prey in between the huge pine trees of the forest.
Permafrost Slime: A slime covered in ice spikes that hurts to touch.
Snowman Slimes: A white colored slime with coal eyes and a carrot nose.

### New Food
Mashua: A weird colored oca oca that acts like an odd onion. Favoured by the Aurora Slime.
Snowy Hen: A grey colored hen hen that resists the cold. Favoured by the Lycan Slime.
Chillberry: A blue colored berry. Favoured by the Permafrost Slime.
Iceberg Lettuce: Favoured by the Snowman Slimes.

### Sub Areas (All within the one snowy forest area)
Pine Forest: A bunch of huge pine trees that you can climb up that is home to Lycan Slimes and Snowy Hens.
Frozen Terrace (Mountain): Severals hills that lead up to a peak where you can look down on the snowy forest and gives you a good view of the Northern Lights (Aurora slimes will spawn up here).
Dry Ice Caves: A really dangerous cold area that is home to the new Permafrost Slimes.
Geothermal Pit: An unusually hot pit will be home to mosaic and fire slimes.
Archaeologist Paradise: A cave full of frozen slime fossils (that you use the drill to dig for).
Hot Springs: A warm pond where you can get the new spring water vaccable, and is home to puddle slimes.
