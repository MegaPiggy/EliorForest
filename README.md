Snowman Slimes: A white colored slime with coal eyes and a carrot nose.<br/>
Steam Slimes: A dark blue colored gaseous slime that can fly.<br/>

### New Food
Mashua: A weird colored oca oca that acts like an odd onion. Favoured by the Aurora Slime.<br/>
Snowy Hen: A grey colored hen hen that resists the cold. Favoured by the Lycan Slime.<br/>
Chillberry: A blue colored berry. Favoured by the Permafrost Slime.<br/>
Iceberg Lettuce: Favoured by the Snowman Slimes.<br/>

### Sub Areas (All within the one snowy forest area)
Pine Forest: A bunch of huge pine trees that you can climb up that is home to Lycan Slimes and Snowy Hens.<br/>
Frozen Terrace (Mountain): Severals hills that lead up to a peak where you can look down on the snowy forest and gives you a good view of the Northern Lights (Aurora slimes will spawn up here).<br/>
Dry Ice Caves: A really dangerous cold area that is home to the new Permafrost Slimes.<br/>
Geothermal Pit: An unusually hot pit will be home to mosaic and fire slimes.<br/>
Archaeologist Paradise: A cave full of frozen slime fossils (that you use the drill to dig for).<br/>
